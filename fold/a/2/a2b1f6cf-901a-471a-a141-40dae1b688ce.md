This file implements a comprehensive user management and authentication system with two main service classes: UserService for CRUD operations on users and AuthService for token-based authentication. The module defines TypeScript interfaces and types for type-safe user data handling, including User interface, UserRole type union, and UserServiceConfig. It follows an event-driven architecture pattern with UserService extending EventEmitter to emit lifecycle events, and includes utility functions for date formatting and user role validation.
