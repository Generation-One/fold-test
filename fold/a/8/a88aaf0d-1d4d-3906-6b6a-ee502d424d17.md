This file implements a data processing system with a DataPoint dataclass and DataProcessor class for managing, filtering, and analyzing numerical data points. The DataProcessor provides functionality to add data points, filter by threshold values, calculate statistics, and export data to JSON format. It demonstrates common data processing patterns including list comprehensions, optional return types, and file I/O operations, serving as a utility module for data analysis workflows.
