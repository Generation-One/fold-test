This file implements a data processing system with a DataPoint dataclass and DataProcessor class for managing, filtering, and analyzing numerical data points. The processor supports threshold-based filtering, statistical calculations (average), and JSON export functionality. It demonstrates a clean separation of concerns using dataclasses for data representation and a dedicated processor class for business logic, following a simple service-oriented architectural pattern suitable for data pipeline applications.
