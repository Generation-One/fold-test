This file implements a data processing system with a DataPoint dataclass for representing individual measurements and a DataProcessor class for aggregating, filtering, and exporting data. The module demonstrates common data processing patterns including threshold-based filtering, statistical calculations (average), and JSON serialization. It follows a clean architecture approach with clear separation between data models and processing logic, suitable for sensor data or time-series analysis applications.
