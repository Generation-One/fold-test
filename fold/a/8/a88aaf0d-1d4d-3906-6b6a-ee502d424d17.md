This file implements a data processing system that manages and analyzes collections of data points with filtering and aggregation capabilities. The DataProcessor class provides functionality to add data points, filter them by threshold values, calculate statistics, and export results to JSON format. It demonstrates a practical application of dataclasses for structured data representation and implements common data processing patterns including filtering, aggregation, and serialization.
