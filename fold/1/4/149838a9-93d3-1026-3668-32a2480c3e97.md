This file implements a UserService class that provides core user management functionality including CRUD operations, profile management, and user preference handling. It serves as a central service layer that coordinates between authentication and database layers, managing user creation, retrieval, updates, and deletion. The service uses dependency injection to integrate with AuthService and Database modules, following a service-oriented architecture pattern with async/await for asynchronous operations.
