This is a README.md file that serves as the primary documentation entry point for a sample mixed-project demonstrating Fold's chunked indexing capabilities. It provides an overview of the project structure, usage instructions, and documentation for a realistic project containing multiple file types including Rust source code and markdown files. The file establishes the project's purpose, outlines its directory structure, and provides basic build and execution commands, functioning as the main user-facing documentation and project guide.
