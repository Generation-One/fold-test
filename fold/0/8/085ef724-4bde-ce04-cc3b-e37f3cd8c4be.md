This TypeScript module provides authentication utilities for validating JWT tokens and creating user sessions. It serves as a core authentication service that handles token validation, user retrieval, and session creation with expiration management. The file implements async/await patterns for database operations and JWT cryptographic operations, following a service-oriented architecture with clear separation between public API functions and internal helper stubs.
