This TypeScript module provides authentication utilities for validating JWT tokens and creating user sessions. It implements core authentication patterns including token verification, expiration checking, and session creation with a 7-day token lifetime. The file serves as a service layer for authentication operations, interfacing with user database lookups and JWT cryptographic operations through helper functions. It demonstrates async/await patterns and type-safe authentication flows using TypeScript interfaces.
