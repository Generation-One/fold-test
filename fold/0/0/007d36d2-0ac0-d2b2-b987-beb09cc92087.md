This file implements a Database class that provides a unified abstraction layer for data persistence operations, supporting connection pooling, query building, and transaction management. It serves as a central data access component used by services like UserService and AuthService, offering generic CRUD operations (insert, find, update, delete) with type-safe generics and connection lifecycle management. The implementation follows the Repository pattern with try-finally blocks ensuring proper connection release and includes transaction support for atomic operations across multiple queries.
