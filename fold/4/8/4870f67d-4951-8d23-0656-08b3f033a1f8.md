This markdown file serves as comprehensive documentation for the Fold project's test suite, outlining test categories, prerequisites, and execution procedures. It defines 16+ automated tests covering API endpoints, database operations, semantic vector search, memory decay, embeddings, and Git workflows, along with detailed instructions for running tests and expected outputs. The file acts as both a test specification document and a reference guide for developers to understand the testing infrastructure and verify core functionality of the Fold system.
