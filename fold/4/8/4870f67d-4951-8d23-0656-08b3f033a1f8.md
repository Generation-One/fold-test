This markdown file serves as the master test plan and documentation for the Fold system, a semantic memory and git integration platform. It outlines 16+ automated tests covering API endpoints, database operations, semantic vector search with Qdrant embeddings, memory decay algorithms, and git workflow integration. The document provides prerequisites, test categories, execution instructions, expected outputs, and references to supporting test scripts, functioning as both a specification and verification checklist for the entire test suite.
