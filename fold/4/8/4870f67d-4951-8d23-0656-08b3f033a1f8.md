This markdown file serves as the primary test plan documentation for the Fold project, outlining a comprehensive testing strategy covering 16+ automated tests and several manual test categories. It documents prerequisites, test categories spanning health checks, project management, memory operations, semantic search, and git workflows, along with detailed instructions for running tests and expected outputs. The file acts as both a specification document and a reference guide for developers and QA engineers to understand the testing scope, verify system functionality, and validate core features including semantic vector search, memory decay algorithms, and webhook integration.
