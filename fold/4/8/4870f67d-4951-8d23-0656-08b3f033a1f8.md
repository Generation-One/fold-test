This markdown file serves as a comprehensive test plan and documentation for the Fold system, detailing all test categories, prerequisites, and execution procedures. It outlines 16+ automated tests covering API endpoints, database operations, semantic vector search with Qdrant embeddings, memory decay functionality, and git workflow integration. The document provides setup instructions, expected test outputs, and references to various test scripts that verify core functionality across health checks, project management, memory operations, embedding providers, and semantic search capabilities.
