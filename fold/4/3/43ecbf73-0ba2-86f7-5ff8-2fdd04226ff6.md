This file implements a simple Rust library module providing basic mathematical operations (addition and multiplication) and a stateful Counter struct for tracking numeric values. It serves as a foundational utility library for the sample project, demonstrating core Rust patterns including function definitions, struct implementation, and method encapsulation. The module includes comprehensive documentation via doc comments and includes unit tests to verify the correctness of both arithmetic functions and the Counter struct's increment and retrieval operations.
