This markdown document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of a user management system, detailing four core components (Database Layer, Authentication Service, User Service, and API Routes) and their interdependencies. It outlines the complete data flow from client request through authentication validation, business logic execution, and database persistence, while emphasizing security considerations including bcrypt password hashing, JWT token expiration, and token revocation mechanisms. The document serves as a reference guide for understanding the system's layered architecture and security posture.
