This markdown document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of a user management system, detailing the layered structure comprising database, authentication, user service, and API route components. It outlines the dependencies between components, the request-response data flow from client through middleware to database persistence, and critical security considerations including password hashing, JWT token management, and token revocation. The architecture follows a service-oriented pattern with clear separation of concerns and dependency hierarchy.
