This markdown document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of a user management system, detailing its layered component structure including database, authentication, user service, and API route layers. It describes the dependencies between components, the request-response data flow through the system, and critical security considerations such as bcrypt password hashing, JWT token expiration, and token revocation mechanisms. The architecture follows a service-oriented pattern with clear separation of concerns, where each layer has distinct responsibilities and explicit dependencies on lower layers.
