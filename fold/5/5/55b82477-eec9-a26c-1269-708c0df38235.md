This markdown file provides a comprehensive overview and summary of the AST-based file chunking test suite for Fold v2, documenting 70+ unit tests and 7 integration tests across multiple test files. It serves as the central reference document for understanding the chunking system's test coverage, including chunk structure validation, language-specific parsing (Rust, TypeScript, Python, Markdown), vectorization, and chunk-level search functionality. The file outlines the complete testing strategy, test categories, chunk model fields, supported languages, and provides guidance on running and validating the chunking system.
