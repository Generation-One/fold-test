This markdown file provides a comprehensive overview and summary of the AST-based file chunking test suite for Fold v2, documenting 70+ unit tests and 7 integration tests across multiple test files. It details the chunking system's coverage of semantic code units (functions, classes, methods), vectorization with embeddings, parent memory linking, and chunk-level search functionality. The document serves as both a high-level project summary and a reference guide for understanding the complete test infrastructure, language support matrix, and chunk model fields validated across Rust, TypeScript, Python, and Markdown file types.
