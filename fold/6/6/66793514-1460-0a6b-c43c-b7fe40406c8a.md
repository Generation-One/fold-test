This markdown documentation file provides comprehensive setup instructions for configuring and running tests against the Fold server application. It covers prerequisites, step-by-step configuration of dependencies (Qdrant, Gemini API), server startup procedures, API token creation and management, environment variable configuration, and troubleshooting guidance. The guide serves as the primary reference for developers setting up their local test environment and includes both PowerShell and bash command examples to support cross-platform development workflows.
