This markdown file provides comprehensive setup and testing instructions for the Fold server project, including prerequisites, configuration steps, and troubleshooting guidance. It documents the complete workflow from environment setup through API token creation and test execution, covering both PowerShell and bash environments. The guide serves as the primary reference documentation for developers setting up the testing infrastructure and running integration tests against the Fold server with vector database (Qdrant) and AI embeddings (Gemini API) support.
