This markdown document serves as a comprehensive testing guide for Fold v2's AST-based file chunking system, which breaks source files into semantic units (functions, classes, methods) for fine-grained indexing and search. It documents 70+ contract-based tests and end-to-end HTTP integration tests that validate chunking behavior, vectorization, storage, and search accuracy across multiple programming languages. The guide provides detailed test categories, expected behaviors, and validation criteria for ensuring the chunking pipeline works correctly from file ingestion through semantic search.
