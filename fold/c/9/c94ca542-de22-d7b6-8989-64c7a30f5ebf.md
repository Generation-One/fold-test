This file implements an AuthService class that handles user authentication, token lifecycle management, and session validation for a backend system. It manages login credentials verification, JWT-like token creation and validation, token refresh mechanisms, and token revocation. The service follows a dependency injection pattern, working closely with a Database abstraction layer for persistence and employing async/await patterns for all database operations.
