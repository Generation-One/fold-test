This markdown file serves as technical documentation for the Fold semantic knowledge storage system, detailing its core architecture, features, and implementation decisions. It describes a three-component system consisting of a Qdrant vector database for semantic search, SQLite metadata store, and Rust/Axum API server. The document provides usage examples, architectural rationale, and decision records explaining technology choices, functioning as both user guide and architectural reference for the holographic memory system.
