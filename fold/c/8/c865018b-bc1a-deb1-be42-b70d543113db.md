This markdown file serves as comprehensive documentation for the Fold semantic knowledge storage system, detailing its core architecture, features, and implementation decisions. It describes a three-component system consisting of a Qdrant vector database for semantic search, SQLite metadata store, and Rust/Axum API server that work together to provide holographic memory capabilities with Git integration. The document includes usage examples, architectural rationale, and decision records that explain technology choices and alternatives considered for the system's design.
