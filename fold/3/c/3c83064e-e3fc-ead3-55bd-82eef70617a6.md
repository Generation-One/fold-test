This file defines Express router endpoints for a REST API that handles user authentication, token management, and user profile operations. It integrates UserService and AuthService to provide login, token refresh, user retrieval, preference updates, and account deletion functionality. The implementation uses async/await patterns with centralized error handling and implements a custom authentication middleware for protecting user-specific routes. The architecture follows a service-oriented pattern where the router acts as a controller layer delegating business logic to dedicated service classes.
