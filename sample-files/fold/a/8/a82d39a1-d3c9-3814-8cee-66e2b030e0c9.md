This file defines Express router endpoints for a REST API that handles user authentication, token management, and user profile operations. It integrates UserService and AuthService to provide login, token refresh, user retrieval, preference updates, and account deletion functionality. The implementation uses async/await patterns with centralized error handling and includes a custom authentication middleware that validates bearer tokens before allowing access to protected routes. The architecture follows a service-oriented pattern with dependency injection, separating concerns between routing, business logic, and data access layers.
