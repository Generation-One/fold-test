This markdown file provides a comprehensive architectural overview of a user management system, detailing the layered structure comprising database, authentication, user service, and API route components. It documents the system's data flow from client requests through middleware validation to database persistence, and outlines critical security considerations including password hashing, JWT token management, and token revocation mechanisms. The architecture follows a service-oriented pattern with clear dependency hierarchies and separation of concerns across distinct layers.
