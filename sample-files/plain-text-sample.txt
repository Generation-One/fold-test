Meeting Notes: Project Planning Session
Date: 2026-02-03
Attendees: Alice, Bob, Charlie

We discussed the upcoming features for the Q1 release. The team agreed
on the following priorities and timeline. Main focus will be on improving
search quality and adding new integrations.

Action items from today's meeting include reviewing the current architecture
documentation and proposing improvements. Each team member will prepare
their section by end of week.

Technical Discussion Points

The backend team presented their findings on vector search performance.
Current benchmarks show 50ms average latency for queries under 1000 documents.
We need to improve this to under 20ms for production readiness.

Several optimization strategies were proposed including batch processing,
caching frequently accessed embeddings, and using approximate nearest neighbor
algorithms instead of exact matching.

Frontend Updates

The new dashboard design was approved with minor revisions. Key changes include
a simplified navigation menu, improved search bar placement, and better
visualisation of memory relationships.

Mobile responsiveness remains a priority. The team will focus on breakpoints
at 768px and 1024px to cover tablet and desktop views respectively.

Infrastructure Notes

Docker deployment has been streamlined. The new compose file includes
health checks and automatic restarts. Production deployments should use
the provided Kubernetes manifests instead.

Monitoring setup needs improvement. Current logging is insufficient for
debugging production issues. Proposal to add structured logging with
correlation IDs for request tracing.

Next Steps

Weekly sync meetings will continue on Tuesdays at 10am.
Sprint planning for next cycle scheduled for Friday.
Code freeze for Q1 release is February 28th.

End of meeting notes.
